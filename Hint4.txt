To workout between the witnesses easily, let segregrate the links we are trying to make with different scenarios (tables)

-- ***** WITNESS 1 : Morty Schapiro ******
			 
-- 1. dl
-- id	age	height	eye_color	hair_color	gender	plate_number	car_make	car_model
-- 118009	64	84	blue	white	male	00NU00	Mercedes-Benz	E-Class

-- 2. fb
-- person_id	event_id	event_name	date
-- 14887	4719	The Funky Grooves Tour	20180115

-- 3. membership
-- could not find data for the membership

-- 4. Check-In Logs
-- no data, as no membership_id

Seems like we hit the dead-end, lets go for our second witness
TRY to write your thoughts as you investigate further



-- ***** WITNESS 2 : Annabel Miller ******

-- 1. dl
-- id	age	height	eye_color	hair_color	gender	plate_number	car_make	car_model
-- 490173	35	65	green	brown	female	23AM98	Toyota	Yaris

-- 2. fb
-- person_id	event_id	event_name	date
-- 16371	4719	The Funky Grooves Tour	20180115

-- 3. membership
-- id	person_id	name	membership_start_date	membership_status
-- 90081	16371	Annabel Miller	20160208	gold

-- 4. Check-In Logs
-- membership_id	check_in_date	check_in_time	check_out_time
-- 90081	20180109	1600	1700

-- 5. Income
-- no data about her income

-- 6. Interview (so someone had recorded Annabel's statement which is stored in this table)
-- person_id	transcript
-- 16371	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

-- 7. Back to check-in logs for the gym
-- membership_id	check_in_date	check_in_time	check_out_time
-- X0643	20180109	957	1164
-- UK1F2	20180109	344	518
-- XTE42	20180109	486	1124
-- 1AE2H	20180109	461	944
-- 6LSTG	20180109	399	515
-- 7MWHJ	20180109	273	885
-- GE5Q8	20180109	367	959
-- 48Z7A	20180109	1600	1730
-- 48Z55	20180109	1530	1700
-- 90081	20180109	1600	1700 	(Annabel)

-- membership
-- SELECT * FROM person WHERE id IN
-- (SELECT person_id FROM facebook_event_checkin WHERE person_id IN
-- (Select person_id FROM get_fit_now_member
-- WHERE id IN (SELECT membership_id FROM get_fit_now_check_in WHERE check_in_date = '20180109'))
-- AND date = '20180115'
-- AND person_id IS NOT '16371') -- not Annabel


-- SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ???????

-- Both of them( witnesses) have the same event listed 'The Funky Grooves Tour' on the same day
-- Annabel has some get fit membership and she went there the next day between
-- 4 - 5pm on the day Jan 15 2018. (It's the same day the murder happened.. 
-- WOW... we have some leads)
-- Annabel saw the murder happen, and 
-- she recognizes the killer from her gym while working out last week
-- on January the 9th. Need to pull records for this date from check_in
-- There are 10 people out of which one is Annabel, so we have a suspect list among 9 people
-- lets trace their fb_activity through person for Jan 15 , the murder day
-- We have a suspect '(Hope you got the name)'. Lets pull his record

This is the last Hint, I have not names the murderer but the I have almost given you the solution.
There is final file which list the murderer, use that only to cross check your answer.
I hope you enjoyed solving the case until now.
