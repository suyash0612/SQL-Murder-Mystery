# SQL-Murder-Mystery

https://mystery.knightlab.com/


The SQL Murder Mystery is a super interesting game if you love solving problems with SQL. It pushes you to think creatively. People having experience writing SQL should avoid following the guided track and try to do it on your own. Trust me you will find the 'Murderer'. 

If you still feel stuck, I have document each and every step of solving this mystery, navigating through each table. I have not provided the direct solution which is available on the website. This repo covers a more of a descriptive roadmap which should provide you hints.

The case is broken down into 4 hints, the Murderer txt file should only be referred to verify the murderer. 
You'll get spoliers and lose interest if you check that file first

Hope you enjoying solving the Murder Case
